            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
              Bali's history is marked by a rich tapestry of cultures and
              influences. It was originally inhabited by Austronesian peoples,
              with the first documented kingdom, the Warmadewa dynasty, emerging
              around the 10th century. In the subsequent centuries, Bali saw the
              rise and fall of various Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, often facing
              threats from neighboring Java. The island was later influenced by
              Majapahit and subsequently by Islamic sultanates. However, it is
              the spread of Hinduism, particularly during the Majapahit era,
              that has left a lasting impact on Bali's culture and religious
              practices. The Dutch colonization of Indonesia in the 19th century
              led to Bali becoming a part of the Dutch East Indies. Bali's
              modern history includes Japanese occupation during World War II
              and, ultimately, its inclusion in the independent nation of
              Indonesia in 1945. Today, Bali remains a vibrant center of
              Balinese Hindu culture and a popular tourist destination known for
              its unique blend of tradition and tourism.
